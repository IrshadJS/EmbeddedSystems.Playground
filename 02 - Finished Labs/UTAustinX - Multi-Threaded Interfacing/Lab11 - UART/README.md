Introduction to Serial Communication
=================
This chapter provides an introduction to serial interfacing, which means we send one bit at time. In Lab11 I will learn how to write software that converts numbers into ASCII strings and display the string on the display connected to UART0. 


Learning Objectives
=================

* I/O synchronization.
* Models of I/O devices (busy, done, off).
* Learn how to program the UART.
* Build a distributed system by connecting two systems together.
* Learn how to convert between numbers and ASCII strings
