C13 DAC and Sound
=================
This chapter presents a technique for the system to generate an analog output using a **digital to analog converter** (DAC). Together with periodic interrupts the system can generate waveforms, which are analog voltages that vary in time and in amplitude. We will then connect the waveform to a speaker and generate sound.


Learning Objectives
=================

* Develop a means for a digital computer to interact with the analog world.
* Study digitization: Quantization, range, precision and resolution.
* Introduce sampling and the Nyquist Theorem.
* Study the basics of sound: electromagnets, speakers, AC vs. DC power, perception of sound.
* Understand how to create sound: loudness, pitch, envelope, and shape
* Use SysTick to create sounds by programming variable frequencies.
