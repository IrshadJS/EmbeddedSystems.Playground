C13 DAC and Sound
=================
This chapter presents a technique for the system to generate an analog output using a **digital to analog converter** (DAC). Together with periodic interrupts the system can generate waveforms, which are analog voltages that vary in time and in amplitude. We will then connect the waveform to a speaker and generate sound.
