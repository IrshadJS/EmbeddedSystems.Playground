What I learned 
=================
* Understanding of embedded systems using modular design and abstraction
* C programming: considering both function and style
* Build and test circuits with switches, LEDs, resistors, potentiometers, and liquid crystal displays
* Synchronizing hardware and software input/output with switches, lights, sound, sensors. motors, and liquid crystal displays
* Implement an I/O driver and multi-threaded programming using interrupts
* Debug using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation
* Learn how to read a data sheet
* Construct a smart object and create a system as part of the Internet of Things
