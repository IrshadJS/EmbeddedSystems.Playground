C14 ADC and Data Acquisition
=================
In this chapter we will focus on input devices that we use to gather information about the world. More specifically, we present a technique for the system to measure analog inputs using an analog to digital converter (ADC). We will use periodic interrupts to sample the ADC at a fixed rate. We will then combine sensors, the ADC, software, PWM output and motor interfaces to implement intelligent control on our robot car.

Learning Objectives
=================

* Develop a means for a digital computer to sense its analog world.
* Review digitization: Quantization, range, precision and resolution.
* Extend the Nyquist Theorem to cases the ADC is used to sense information.
* Study the basics of transducers: conversion of physical to electrical.
* Use an optical sensor to measure distance to an object.
