Embedded Systems Playground
=================
This repo contains all my trials and tribulations with Embedded Systems. It contains materials used for learnig C and C++ for embedded systems, writing HDL's, SoCs, and tinkering with microcontrollers, FPGA's CPLD's, and anything in between. 

> :exclamation: I've organized the source codes into thier respective manufacturer chipsets. This should make it easier for potential employers better understand what platforms I have experiance with, the depth of my experiance, and how recent my last learning session was.
