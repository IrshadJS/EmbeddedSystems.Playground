Embedded Systems Playground
=================
This repo contains all my trials and tribulations with Embedded Systems. It contains learning materials, labs, etc.. involving many diffrent languages such as VHDL, Verilog, Lucid, C, C++, and many others I may come accross for embedded systems like FPGA's, CPLD's, SoC's, and microcontrollers, on popular core architechtures (Cortex M, Spartan, PSoC, AVR, Max3000, etc.).

>I've organized the source codes into thier respective manufacturer chipsets. This should make it easier for potential employers to better understand what platforms I have experiance in, the depth of my experiance, and how recent my last learning session was for a particular platform.

### My personal languange preference

| Platform Name        | Language           |
| ------------- |:--------------------:|
| CPLD     | VHDL |
| FPGA     | Verilog |
| Microcontrollers     | C and C++ |
| SoC     | Cypress's PSoC IDE |
