Embedded Systems Playground
=================
I grew tired of the simplicity offered by Arduino and needed something more challenging. Developing drivers for sensors in C++ seems like the next step up and in order to get there, I needed to master programming embedded systems in C.  

This repo contains all my trials and tribulations with my progress in learning how to properly use C++'s OOP abstraction with C in embedded systems. Review my code, comment, and fork. If you'd like to see my progress with C++ you may visit https://github.com/glennlopez/Cpp.Playground
