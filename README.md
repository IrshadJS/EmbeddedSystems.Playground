Embedded Systems Playground
=================
This repo contains all my trials and tribulations with Embedded Systems. It contains learning materials, labs, etc.. involving many diffrent languages such as VHDL, Verilog, Lucid, C, and C++, for embedded systems such as FPGA's, CPLD's, SoC's, microcontrollers, from industry standard platfroms (Arm Cortex, Spartan-6, PSoC5) and hobyist platfrom (AVR, Max3000, PIC).

>I've organized the source codes into thier respective manufacturer chipsets. This should make it easier for potential employers better understand what platforms I have experiance with, the depth of my experiance, and how recent my last learning session was.
