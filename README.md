Embedded Systems Playground
=================
I grew tired of the simplicity offered by Arduino and needed something more challenging. Developing drivers for sensors in C++ seems like the next step up and in order to get there, I needed to master programming embedded systems.

This repo contains all my trials and tribulations with that progress. Reviewing my code, you'll witness my evolution from zero to hero while(1);
