Embedded Systems Playground
=================
I grew tired of the simplicity offered by Arduino and needed something more challenging. Developing drivers for sensors in C++ seems like the next step up and in order to get there, I needed to master programming embedded systems.

This repo contains all my trials and tribulations with programming embedded systems. Review it, comment on it, and help me improve by criticizing my work.
