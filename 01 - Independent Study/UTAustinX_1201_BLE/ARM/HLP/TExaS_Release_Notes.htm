<h1 style="text-align: center;">Release Notes for TExaS Part 2</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Starter projects for Labs 4 (optional), and 6&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">UT.12.01x Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape The
World</h2>
<p>This installer adds four components to the RTBN course, including the bug fix for Lab 6. <b> 1) Lab 6: Bluetooth.</b> There are four BLE projects available as you learn Bluetooth,  all of which require the
CC2650 LaunchPad or CC2650 BoosterPack. <b> VerySimpleApplicationProcessor</b>  is a barebones
BLE example. <b> ApplicationProcessor</b> is a more abstract BLE example. There are two lab 6 starter projects,
one project based on Lab 1, and another based on Lab 3. The <b>Lab6wLab1_xxx</b> project will run without an operating system.
The <b>Lab6wLab3_xxx</b> project requires the OS with blocking semaphores from Lab 3.</p>
<p><b>2) Logic analyzer</b>
There is a new project called <b>TExaSDisplay</b>
that shows the inner workings of the TExaS logic analyzer. The TM4C123 version of this
project also adds an oscilloscope. </p><p>
<b>3) Hand-help video game</b>
There is also a new optional Lab 4 that runs
a hand held video game. If you finish your regular lab 4 you can import
your Lab 4 OS into this project and run the video game. This version of the OS has two new featues, dynamic thread creation and destruction.
In particular, you can add threads one at time at run time. Furthermore, a thread can kill itself (OS_Kill), freeing its resources. 
This system supports up to 20 threads and uses PendSV to launch a new thread during OS_Kill();
</p><p>
<b>4)Bug fixes.</b> This installer includes the fix of the MSP432 bug that incorrectly set the clock speed to 48 MHz.
Test EXecute, And Simulate, called <span style="font-weight: bold;">TExaS</span>,
is a collection of DLL
plugins that transform Keil uVision into learning environment for
embedded systems. These plugins provide simulation of the Texas
Instruments Tiva LaunchPad.
The suite also includes a stand-alone application called TExaSdisplay, which provides a serial port interface. 
When operating with the code embedded on the microcontroller, TExaSdisplay also provides a oscilloscope
and logic analyzer functionality. 
 Furthermore, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TExaS</span> can be used for
automatic grading of labs on the real board for UT.12.01x.<br>

This is version 2.28, built November 20, 2016 and includes all software for
the course. This version
was rebuilt without SSE2 so it should run on vintage PCs with AthlonXP or PIII processors.<br>
