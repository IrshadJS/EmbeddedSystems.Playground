AlteraMax Playground
=================
This is where I keep all the fun things I do with Altera's MAX series CPLD's. From testing out sensors, shields, and algorythms to learning how it works and how it can be implemented into a larger project.

> Altera's MAXÂ® CPLD series has provided the lowest power, lowest cost CPLDs. The introduction of the new MAX 10 FPGAs present a leap forward in integration and FPGA capabilities for a non-volatile programmable logic device.
