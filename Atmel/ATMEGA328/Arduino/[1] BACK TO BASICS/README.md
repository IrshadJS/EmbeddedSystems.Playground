### About
BTB (Back to Basics) is all about learning how to program in C, C++ all over again. It is intended for people who have prior knowledge of programming, who stopped using arduino for a while and came back to realize they forgot half the stuff they once knew. The hardware used will be basic and provided in a .fzz schematic file format to make everything simple. 

It's recomended that you download [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/) (an electronic design automation tool for non-engineers) to view the layouts required for the tutorials.
